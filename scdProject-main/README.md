# DocDoc
DocDoc is a full-stack Doctor Appointment Booking System built with the MERN stack. The platform allows patients to book appointments with doctors, manage their appointments, and make payments online. Doctors can manage their schedules, view earnings, and interact with patients. Admins have full control over doctor and patient management.
The name is DocDoc so the patients can knock knock on the doctor's door for appointment but online.
